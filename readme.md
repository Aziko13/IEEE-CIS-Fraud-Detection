# IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection

This project is for Kaggle competition. The problem was to identify fraud transactions.
All details can be found [here] [https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/submissions]

## Getting Started

Solution gives 42nd place out of 6385 (top 1%, silver). The main idea is to identify UserID 
and make FE around this IDs.
The final solution is an average of Catboost, LightGBM, XGBoost and LightMort models.
 
The first one has to generate dataframes for boosting algotithms, files dataUpdate_1.py and dataUpdate_2.py
have to be launched. These files generate train2.pkl, train3.pkl, test2.pkl and test3.pkl. 
Then one has to generate submissions using boosting algorithms, run catboost.py, lightgbm.py and xgboost.py. 
One more solution can be found [here][https://github.com/closest-git/ieee_fraud]. 
The final submission can be generated by running blending.py file. 
The blending gives ROC AUC = 0.936.
